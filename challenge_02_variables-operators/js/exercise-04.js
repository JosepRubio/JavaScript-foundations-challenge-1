/*
    What would each of these lines of code do:

    1. true && console.log("moo");
    The "&&" operator checks both operands; in this case, the first operand is true. 
    As a result, it executes the second one, which is the instruction, and prints "moo."
    
    2. false && console.log("moo moo?");
    In this case, the first operand is false, so it won't execute the second one, and nothing will be printed.

    3. true || console.log("hello friend");
    The "||" operator checks both operands; in this case, the first operand is true. 
    As a result, it won't evaluate the second one because it's true, and it won't print anything to the screen.

    4. false || console.log("bye friend");
    In this case, since the first operand is false, it will evaluate the second one. 
    The second one is an instruction, so it will execute it and print something to the screen.

    Once you see the results, write in a comment why it works that way
